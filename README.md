## ðŸ“„ Paper Abstract

The paper presents a pioneering approach to **image super-resolution** (SR), which refers to reconstructing a high-resolution (HR) image from its low-resolution (LR) counterpart. Unlike traditional interpolation-based methods (e.g., bicubic), SRCNN leverages deep learning to directly learn the mapping from LR to HR images. This deep learning approach achieves state-of-the-art performance by employing three main steps:
1. **Patch extraction and feature representation** - Extracts image patches and maps them to high-dimensional feature space.
2. **Non-linear mapping** - Maps extracted features to their high-resolution counterparts.
3. **Reconstruction** - Combines features to produce the high-resolution output.

This repository implements the SRCNN architecture using PyTorch and provides a clear and beginner-friendly introduction to deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
